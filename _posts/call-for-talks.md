The OSR is the place for OHBM meeting attendees to discuss open research practices, learn from each other, collaborate, and to foster and grow an open and inclusive community.

We have two exciting announcements!

### 1. The call for OSR talks is now open! 

We have opened the call for educational talks (+ demos) and panel discussions in this year's hybrid Open Science Room at the [*virtual* annual meeting of the OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1).
This year, presentations and discussions will focus on three main themes:
- Open Workflows
- Open Data 2.0
- The Past, Present and Future of Open Neuroimaging

Check out our website to find out more about [talk formats](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/formats/), and [open review](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/review/), or to [submit your talk](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/submit/)!

### 2. Apply for an OSR speaker mini-grant!

We are providing 20 mini-grants worth 100 USD each to help OSR speakers set up for online conferencing.

These are ideal to assist with buying essential online communication equipment, data packages, or related expenses.
Applicants can also suggest a different use of the mini-grant based on their specific needs.

Find more information and apply as part of the [OSR talk submission process](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/submit/).

### Important dates

The first round of submissions is ***open until (15 May 2021)***.

<!--After 15 May 2021, initial talk recordings will start.-->
To smooth the flow of a virtual conference, we aim to prerecord [Lightning and Demo talks](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/formats/). We are finalising details of this process and will share more information or requirements as soon as they are available.

The second and last round of submissions is ***open until 15 June 2021***.

Don't miss it!

Yes! We would love for the community to be involved in building an unforgettable OSR experience.
