We have a few important updates from the Open Science Room:

### 1. The call for OSR talks is now CLOSED
Submission is now CLOSED for talks in this year's virtual Open Science Room, **except for emergent and invited sessions**.

We will be notifying successful applicants soon to start recordings.

We communicated previously that there would be a second call for talks, but due to the happy situation of being flooded with submissions, we have decided to close the call and allow time to focus on delivering the best content we can in the time available.

If you missed the opportunity to submit a talk and you feel it would be of great benefit to the community you can [**reach out to us directly**](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/contact/) to consider your proposal.

### 2. Emergent session submissions are now CLOSED
Emergent sessions can still be submitted leading up to and during the meeting. Which important or controversial topics would you like to see in the OSR? Do you want to lead an informal panel discussion? [**Send us your ideas**](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/submit/)!

### 3. Join the open community review process!
We'd love to hear your feedback on the emergent session submissions. All submissions are available [**here as Github issues**](https://github.com/ohbm/osr2020/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Emergent+session). Feel free to add an emoji (:100: :clap: :heart:) to the abstracts you like, or start a conversation with the authors by commenting!
