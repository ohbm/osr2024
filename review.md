title: Review Proposals
---

<p align="justify">
All talk proposals will undergo open community review before decisions are made on what material to include in our program. The final selection of presentations is determined by the OS-SIG through a combination of community interest, relatedness to our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/osr2021/formats">Formats</a>, and diversity of representation.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You are welcome to review all talk submissions on our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/osr2021/submit">submission form</a>. We also invite you to comment on items tagged as "emergent", and get in contact with the organisers if you are interested in joining the discussion.
</p>

You are reminded that you will be expected to communicate on these proposals in accordance with the
<a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3912">Code of Conduct</a>.

In order to comment on or endorse a proposal, you will be required to log into GitHub.
